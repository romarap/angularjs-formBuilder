<!-- Markup for lists inside the dropzone. It's inside a seperate template
     because it will be used recursively. The dnd-list directive enables
     to drop elements into the referenced array. The dnd-draggable directive
     makes an element draggable and will transfer the object that was
     assigned to it. If an element was dragged away, you have to remove
     it from the original list yourself using the dnd-moved attribute -->

<ul dnd-list="list" 
    dnd-drop="dropCallback(event, index, item)">
    <li ng-repeat="item in list"
        dnd-draggable="item"
        dnd-effect-allowed="move"
        dnd-moved="list.splice($index, 1)"
        dnd-selected="models.selected = item"
        ng-class="{selected: models.selected === item}"
        ng-include="'views/includes/field-templates/' + item.type + '.html'"
        ng-dblclick="open($event,'',item);">
    </li>
 </ul>
